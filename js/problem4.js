 Rs.1000.

 Problem statement:
 Write a program that will enable counting of money given in the form of Indian currency notes. The program must take
 a variable number of arguments. These arguments must be summed and the total must be displayed. For any input number
 that does not match a valid currency denomination, ignore the value and stop counting further, displaying the sum
 counted so far.

 Examples:

 Given Rs 10, 20, 100 notes
 When I count the money
 Then my total is Rs 130

 Given Rs 20, 50, 10, 20, 13, 500 notes
 When I count the money
 Then my total is Rs 100
